                    People would try to use the "structureless" group [...] out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything but oppressive.

                  <q>
                    In any profession or organization these networks have created the "locker room" mentality and the "old school" ties which have effectively prevented women as a group [...] from having equal access to the sources of power or social reward.

                  <q>
                    Much of the energy of past women's movements has been directed to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly.
